This assignment utilizes the sprite ralphy.gif and creates a website that is responsive to the width of the page. Following the specifications of the assignment, Different pictures within the sprite are used when the width of the screen is different pixels (<600,601-800, 801-1000, 1001-1200, 1201-1400, >1400).

I spent approximately 2 hours on this project, and used various website to learn about sprites and responsive design.
