Assignment 4
Ben Skach
April 26, 2017

In this assignment, I analyzed the work of my assigned partnet, Ben Ewing, and attempted to find security vulnerabilities in his Assignment 3.

However, I was only able to find 2 vulnerabilities, although there are surely more. One that I tried to exploit was the /vehicle.json query. I was unable to access more data than I should have because of the way that he searched the database to find the queried username.

I received the source code from Ben so that I could analyze how the server worked. I spent approximately 4 hours on this project.
