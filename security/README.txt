Assignment 4
Ben Skach
April 26, 2017

In this assignment, I analyzed the work of my assigned partnet, Ben Ewing, and attempted to find security vulnerabilities in his Assignment 3.

I received the source code from Ben so that I could analyze how the server worked. I spent approximately 4 hours on this project.
