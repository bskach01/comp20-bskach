Lab 9!

1. This git repository contains the code for many of the assignments I completed in comp20. 

2. My favorite assignment in this class was assignment 1, because I had a lot of freedom. I had to learn the basics of html, css, and javascript, but I was able to get creative and make a cool webpage.

3. I've definitely learned a lot throughout this course. From the way webpages load to the code behind databases, I've learned a lot of practical skills as well as knowledge about the way the web works. I definitely have a lot more to learn, but I feel that this class has given me a good start.

4. The most important thing I've learned in this course is probably how to learn on my own. The lectures definitely give an intro to how to do most of the assignments, but I really got better at using google to facilitate my learning. During the first assignment, I used google to find out how to make a dropdown menu and use javascript to make my portfolio website better. During Assignment 4, I was constantly using google to find out how to take advantage of security vulnerabilities. This is something I had to do a lot during the course, and I feel like I have improved.

5. I want to learn more about implementing concepts from other comp sci classes into the web. We've done this a bit in the group project, but I think about this a lot. For example, how do the data structures that we talked about in comp15 get implemented to allow things like LinkedIn and Facebook? There's a lot of overlapping concepts between classes, but I currently don't know how to implement them together.
