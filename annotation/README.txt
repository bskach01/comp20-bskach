This project is a website called "Fail." There is an embedded video of Mariah Carey's "performance" of Emotions on New Years Eve. As the video plays, a javascript function uses the elapsed time of the video to present the lyrics to the song.

I spent an hour or two working on this projects, and used various websites to learn about javascript and eventlisteners.
