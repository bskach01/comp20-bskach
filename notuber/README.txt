Assignment 2

This project uses the Google Maps API to display other users on a map. It uses geolocation to find my own location, then sends that information to a class datastore API. It then receives locations of other students, and displays them on the map as either drivers or passengers, depending on what information is received.

I got my distanceAway function from "http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html". This helped me find out how to calculate the distance between to points on the globe using longitudes and latitudes.

I spent about 7 hours on this project.
